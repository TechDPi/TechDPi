 Hi,

I changed my career into a <a href="https://diegopierleoni.medium.com/">SRE<a> role in 2022.

I am passionate about all things Programming, Cloud, Data and new Technologies. I care to write clean code, I am always excited to learn new skills and help others.

I live in Denmark and love it here :)
