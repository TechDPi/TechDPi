 Hi,

My name is <b>Diego</b>, I am a self taught <a href="https://diegopierleoni.medium.com/">Computer Scientist<a>.

I am passionate about all things Programming, Data and new technologies. I care to write clean code, I am always excited to learn new technologies and help others.

Since 2020 I live in Denmark and studying hard to switch my career into Data engineering. I’m currently learning Data Lakes.
